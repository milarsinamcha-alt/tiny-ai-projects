This file lists all the Python packages required for the app to run.
Hugging Face Spaces reads this file and automatically installs these dependencies.
Required for the web interface and structure of the app
streamlit

Required for interacting with the Google Gemini API
google-genai

If you were using environment files locally (dotenv), you might include it,
but since Hugging Face handles secrets via environment variables, it's not strictly
necessary for the final deployment:
python-dotenv
